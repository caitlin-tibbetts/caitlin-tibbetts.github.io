            <h1>You are Invited!</h1>
            <h2>It's a shotluck!<i class="icon solid fa-whiskey-glass"></i></h2>
            <p><strong>When:</strong> April 27th @ 7 PM CST<br/>
            <strong>Where:</strong> My Apartment, 11400 Domain Dr. #5402, Austin, TX, 78758 <br/>
            <strong>Dress code:</strong> Match with your shot :p<br/>
            Each person brings a shot for the group to try, the weirder the better! There are 13 people invited at the moment. To lower waste, I suggest that if you own shot glasses, please bring them! I'll also have some and some disposable ones as well. Mocktail shots are allowed as well! Just get creative!<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Directions:</strong> park in the Pink garage. Once you park, make your way to 2A. You'll find an elevator, walk past that and out onto the street. Straight ahead, you'll find my courtyard. The code to get in that door and the next one is *1200. Take a left past the mailboxes, take the elevator to the fourth floor, and then take a left and keep walking until you find my apartment! The code to get in the door is 801624.<br/>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <ol>
              <li><em>Can I bring friends?</em> Yes, please, but let the group know beforehand or they might not get any shots! And if you bring lots of friends, consider bringing some extra drinks to offset! If any of your friends have already been blocklisted from my parties, please do not bring them.</li>
              <li><em>Will you be providing food?</em> We'll get pizza or something similar! If I don't already know your dietary restrictions, please let me know.</li>
              <li><em>What's your policy on sleepovers?</em> I have a zero-tolerance policy against drinking and driving (one way to get on the blocklist), so if you need a safe place to stay, I will always provide, no questions asked. That being said, please be aware that if 20 people need to stay over, the accommodations won't be very comfy, so try to have a safe ride plan.</li>
              <li><em>What are your other zero-tolerance rules?</em> #1 Harrassment. I love when people meet each other through my parties, it's a big reason that I throw them, but consent is non-negotiable, and comfort should always be a top-priority. If you feel like someone is/was being inappropriate, feel free to let me know, and I'll handle the situation. #2 Disrespect. Like I mentioned, this is not an event space, so I expect everyone to be respectful of my neighbors out in the hallway when coming and going. If the neighbors have a problem with my parties, I can't throw them! #3 Just generally being an ass, don't do that.</li>
              <li><em>What is your blocklist?</em> I've thrown quite a few parties over the years, and there are a few people that have broken my zero tolerance rules and were asked not to come back. They should know.</li>
