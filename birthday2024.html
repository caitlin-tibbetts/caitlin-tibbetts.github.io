            <h1>You are Invited!</h1>
            <h2>Ahoy mateys!<i class="icon solid fa-cake-candles"></i></h2>
            <p><strong>When:</strong> June 8th @ 9 PM CST<br/>
            <strong>Where:</strong> My Apartment, 11400 Domain Dr. #5402, Austin, TX, 78758 <br/>
            <strong>Dress code:</strong> think pirates, boats, Hawaiian shirts, and swimsuits <br/>
            Caitlin's turning 24 on the high seas (figuratively speaking), and you won't asking where the rum went! I would be honored if you would join me to ring in my 24th year on Earth with a bash fit for a pirate. We'll be shaking our booties and raising the main sail all night, so come through whenever! In lieu of gifts, I'd rather attendees make a donation to the <a href="https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/">Central Texas Food Bank</a>; the summer is the hardest time of the year for a lot of these families, especially those relying on school lunches. Let's make a difference!<br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Directions:</strong> park in the Pink garage. Once you park, make your way to 2A. You'll find an elevator with a leasing office sign next to it, walk past that and out onto the street. Straight ahead, you'll find my courtyard. The code to get in that door and the next one is *1200. Take a left past the mailboxes, take the elevator to the fourth floor, and then take a left and keep walking until you find my apartment!<br/>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <ol>
              <li><em>Can I bring friends?</em> Yes, please! But if you bring lots of friends, consider bringing some extra drinks to offset! If any of your friends have already been blocklisted from my parties, please do not bring them.</li>
              <li><em>Will you be providing food?</em> It's important to eat while drinking, so yes, we will have some snacks and desserts! I recommend eating a meal before coming.</li>
              <li><em>What's your policy on sleepovers?</em> I have a zero-tolerance policy against drinking and driving (one way to get on the blocklist), so if you need a safe place to stay, I will always provide, no questions asked. That being said, please be aware that if 20 people need to stay over, the accommodations won't be very comfy, so try to have a safe ride plan.</li>
              <li><em>What are your other zero-tolerance rules?</em> #1 Harrassment. I love when people meet each other through my parties, it's a big reason that I throw them, but consent is non-negotiable, and comfort should always be a top-priority. If you feel like someone is/was being inappropriate, feel free to let me know, and I'll handle the situation. #2 Disrespect. Like I mentioned, this is not an event space, so I expect everyone to be respectful of my neighbors out in the hallway when coming and going. If the neighbors have a problem with my parties, I can't throw them! #3 Just generally being an ass, don't do that.</li>
              <li><em>What is your blocklist?</em> I've thrown quite a few parties over the years, and there are a few people that have broken my zero tolerance rules and were asked not to come back. They should know.</li>
